# Introduction about the K2BK(Khel Ke Baat karen)

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Autism, in short, is a spectrum disorder that refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech, and nonverbal communication. According to the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects an estimated 1 in 59 children in the United States today. This condition makes it difficult for these children to communicate with their parents, teachers and even their peers. One of the scientific ways to treat autism is Early Intervention where a child who is aged 2-4 years is taught about emotions and many other human interactions. “Khel Ke Baat Karen (K2BK)” is an interactive app/platform for children suffering from ASD (verbal to non-verbal communication), their parents and special educators. One of the common problems faced by these children is that they are unable to manage their time whether its leisure or work. Despite this, autistic children have strong visual skills and recall. K2BK facilitates special educators to set a timetable tailor-made for each autistic child. The app we developed, when deployed in a school for autistic children, will help them communicate better and in turn become more social and inclusive in society. The aim is to make these children communicate easily without the solution costing to their parents.
