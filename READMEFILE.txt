Introduction to Khel Ke Baat Karen

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Autism, in short, is a spectrum disorder that refers to 
a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors,
speech, and nonverbal communication. According to the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects an 
estimated 1 in 59 children in the United States today. This condition makes it difficult for these 
children to communicate with their parents, teachers and even their peers. One of the scientific ways 
to treat autism is Early Intervention where a child who is aged 2-4 years is taught about emotions and 
many other human interactions. “Khel Ke Baat Karen (K2BK)” is an interactive app/platform for children 
suffering from ASD (verbal to non-verbal communication), their parents and special educators. One of the 
common problems faced by these children is that they are unable to manage their time whether its leisure or work. 
Despite this, autistic children have strong visual skills and recall. K2BK facilitates special educators to set a 
timetable tailor-made for each autistic child. The app we developed, when deployed in a school for autistic children, 
will help them communicate better and in turn become more social and inclusive in society. The aim is to make 
these children communicate easily without the solution costing to their parents.
